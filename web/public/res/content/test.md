## Project Description


It is a local web application developed during one of my work placements.
The system is used to manage IFEN’s audiovisual productions.


## Architecture


The application features a responsive, dynamic web interface built with
semantic HTML5, custom CSS, and JavaScript.


Server-side logic is handled by PHP, while a relational MySQL database
ensures structured and reliable data storage.


## Scope of Use


The platform provides a robust CRUD interface for indexing media assets,
including effects, transitions, and sound design.


An integrated alert system monitors retention deadlines and supports
compliance with archival regulations.
